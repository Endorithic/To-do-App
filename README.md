# To-do-App

A simple, CLI todo-app created as a practice project. Not intended for any serious use, or any use at all for that matter, but whatever :P\
App is only tested for windows, but does not make any use of the windows API as of right now as far as I know.

## Current Features
* Adding and removing tasks
* Toggling the status of a task
* Saving current tasks

## WIP Features
* Layout changes
* Color coded priority using ANSI codes?\
  (This would require rewriting the taskfile structure)
* Saving tasks on application close without using 'exit'?
